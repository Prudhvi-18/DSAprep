Q.
Two Sum
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices i and j such that nums[i] + nums[j] == target and i != j.

You may assume that every input has exactly one pair of indices i and j that satisfy the condition.

Return the answer with the smaller index first.


SOL.
public class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
                if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                    return new int[]{i, j};
                }
            }
        }
        return new int[0];
    }
}
**Taken int[] to retrun the new index with the variables nums and target 
**Taken i which checks the all elements by iterating through all elements in the array
**Taken j  it iterates through the elements after the i in the array.
**If nums[i] + nums[j] == target, if these two numbers sum to the given target.
**then the new indices will appear  if NOT equal to the target then it will return the  0th index
