Q.
Given two strings s and t, return true if the two strings are anagrams of each other, otherwise return false.

An anagram is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different.
SOL.
class Solution {
    public boolean isAnagram(String s, String t) 
    {
        if (s.length() != t.length()) {
            return false;
        }
        
        char[] sArray = s.toCharArray();
        char[] tArray = t.toCharArray();
        
        Arrays.sort(sArray);
        Arrays.sort(tArray);
        
        return Arrays.equals(sArray, tArray);
    }

    }

 // The question is anagram or not. Anagram means the same words containing in the two strings.
**we have taken the two variables s and t.
**Program first checks if the two strings have the same length. If they are not equal they can't be anagrams. 
**Then it converts both strings to character arrays by using in built function toCharArray() and sort them and compares them for equality.
**If they are equal of same length and characters then the strings are anagram.
